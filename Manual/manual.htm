                        <p class="flavour-text">I'm not sure what this is, and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The dials, nixie tubes, and lights will update on each solved module*. The current stage is shown on the display, and stages are not in order***.</li>
                            <li>For the first stage, take the dial values. This is your starting solution.</li>
                            <li>For every stage there-after, use the nixie tubes to determine if the stage is valid. If it is, use the dial values to progressively modify your solution.</li>
                            <li>When all** other modules* have been completed, the stage display will turn blank, and the nixie tubes and lights will shut off.</li>
                            <li>Enter your solution into the dials, and turn the key to solve the module.</li>
                            <li>Do not attempt to interact with the module before it is ready to be solved, and always wait for dials to stop before turning the key.</li>
                            <li>Enter a stage number as a solution to show that stage again. This will cause a strike.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Follow these steps to determine if a stage is valid:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the previous two stages were both valid, this stage is not valid.</li>
                            <li>If the previous two stages were both not valid, this stage is valid.</li>
                            <li>If neither of the above apply, this stage is valid if both numbers shown in the nixie tubes are on the dials.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Follow these steps to determine the stage colour:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If three colours are shown, the stage colour is the one that is not shown.</li>
                            <li>Otherwise, the stage colour is the colour that appears multiple times.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Refer to the table below when using a stage to modify the solution.

                        Add or subtract 10 to keep solution numbers in the 0-9 range.<br>
                        When subtracting, subtract the current dial number from the solution number.
                        </br></br>*Some modules are ignored by Forget Everything modules.
                        </br>**If there are more than 99 other modules, this module will be ready for solving after the 99th solved module.
                        </br>***Any rule referring to a stage is referring to the stages after they are put in order.
